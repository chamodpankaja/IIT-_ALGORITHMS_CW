# Algorithms Coursework 2025 â€“ IIT | University of Westminster

This repository contains the implementation of a **maximum flow network solver**, developed as part of the **Algorithms** coursework at the **Informatics Institute of Technology (IIT)**, affiliated with the **University of Westminster (UoW)**.

## ðŸ“š Coursework Summary

The coursework focuses on building a program that calculates the **maximum flow** through a directed network. The solution is developed in **Java** and includes:

- A custom graph data structure to represent flow networks.
- A parser to read flow networks from input files.
- Flow computation between a defined source and target.
- Output showing flow values on each edge and final max flow.
